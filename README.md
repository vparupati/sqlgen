# Gen-SQL: Efficient Text-to-SQL By Bridging Natural Language Question And Database Schema With Pseudo-Schema

[\[Paper\]](https://aclanthology.org/2025.coling-main.256/)

## Prerequisite

### Environment
- Python 3.13
- MPS (Apple Silicon GPU) or CPU

*Refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for required Python packages.*

- NLTK: Run the following code in Python interpreter to download nltk data.
  ```python
  >>> import nltk
  >>> nltk.download('punkt')
  >>> nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
  ```

### Pre-trained Models

**Retriever Model:**
- [bge-large-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5)

Put the retriever model in [pretrained](pretrained).

*LLMs are omitted.*

### Datasets Preprocessing

#### Spider
- Download [Spider](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider) dataset, and unzip `spider.zip` in the [benchmark](benchmark) directory.

#### BIRD
- Download [BIRD](https://bird-bench.github.io/) dataset, and unzip `train.zip` and `dev.zip` in the [benchmark/BIRD](benchmark/BIRD) directory.

*If you are NOT interested in the mass datasets, you may safely skip the next steps.*

#### Spider to Spider-mass
- Merge databases in the root directory (of this project):
  ```shell
  python spider_code/merge_spider_db.py
  ```
  After a few minutes (less than 10 minutes on my server), you can find the merged databases in the directory named `spider_code/spider_ext`.

#### BIRD to BIRD-mass
- Merge databases in the root directory (of this project):
  ```shell
  python bird_code/merge_bird_dev_db.py
  ```
  It may take about an hour until you can find the merged databases in the directory named `bird_code/bird_ext`.

## Running Experiments

### LLM Server Configuration

The application connects to a local LLM server via OpenAI-compatible API. Configure using environment variables:

```bash
# Default configuration (Ollama)
export LLM_HOST=localhost
export LLM_PORT=11434
export LLM_MODEL=llama2  # Optional: specify model name

# Run the application
python main.py
```

Or copy and modify the example config:
```bash
cp config_example.env .env
# Edit .env with your settings
source .env
python main.py
```

### Server Setup Options

**Option 1: Ollama (Recommended for Mac)**
```shell
# Install from https://ollama.ai
ollama serve

# Pull a model
ollama pull llama2

# The server runs on http://localhost:11434 by default
# No additional configuration needed!
```

**Option 2: LM Studio**
```shell
# Download from https://lmstudio.ai
# 1. Start the local server from the UI
# 2. Default port is 1234
# Configure: export LLM_PORT=1234
```

**Option 3: llama-cpp-python**
```shell
# Install
pip install llama-cpp-python[server]

# Run server
python -m llama_cpp.server --model path/to/model.gguf

# Configure: export LLM_PORT=8080
```

### Running the Application

```shell
python main.py
```

The results will be saved to `output/`.
- Execution accuracy:
  - Convert output:
    
    **Spider or Spider-mass:**
    ```shell
    python spider_code/convert_output_ext.py
    ```
    **BIRD or BIRD-mass:**
    ```shell
    python bird_code/convert_output_ext.py
    ```
  - Run evaluation:
    
    **Spider or Spider-mass:**
    ```shell
    . spider_code/eval-sql.sh
    ```
    **BIRD or BIRD-mass:**
    ```shell
    . bird_code/evaluation/run_evaluation.sh
    ```

    abstract = "With the prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have shifted paradigms and leveraged LLMs to tackle the challenging task of Text-to-SQL. Because of the complexity of real world databases, previous works adopt the retrieve-then-generate framework to retrieve relevant database schema and then to generate the SQL query. However, efficient embedding-based retriever suffers from lower retrieval accuracy, and more accurate LLM-based retriever is far more expensive to use, which hinders their applicability for broader applications. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes Gen-SQL, a novel generate-ground-regenerate framework, where we exploit prior knowledge from the LLM to enhance embedding-based retriever and reduce cost. Experiments on several datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method. We release our code and data at https://github.com/jieshi10/gensql."
